ContextPad Development Notes
----------------------------------------------
# Issues
1. Categories normalize to ALL CAPS, but still creates multiple categories even though it is normalized
2. Actions needs a description field in the action builder form
3. Actions needs an indicator to determine if it's a button or a command
4. Aria labels
5. Installed version, double clicking a .md file directly opens it in the contextpad, however just like how drag and drop method had a bug when using at first (opens the files in multiple tabs), double clicking a file from the file explorer opens multiple tabs of the same file.
6. Actions code and variables on locked code block
7. Installed version -- open with contextpad on context menu opens the app but not the file

# Questions
1. ```markdown {loc {lock} --- this works? code block markers support nested arrays? even if the loc -- directive is not a known parameter? and lock which is a directive is detected even it is nested?

# **Future Enhancements:**
1. HTML download, HTML Live Preview
2. AI Blueprint Exports
3. API for connecting another application, OR a way to set a line or area in the editor that captures the last clipboard item and immediately pastes it in the designated area in the editor. Clipboard watcher (preferably watches text copied from a gsheets or excel cell)
4. Adding another feature in the activity bar and another tab: Bookmarked files, can bookmark a file and set an icon so the icon is added as a button on the activity bar, click to switch to the tab, double click to force sync the opened tab with the saved file (must warn user of the effects on unsaved data)
5. locking a code block works, BUT markers can be edited, even If i use hide markers, maybe I also need to add the fences to the hidden and cant be edited parts?
6. Collaboration Features (soft), add a folder watcher feature that can watch gdrive folders, sync contents of the opened file on file changes on the gdrive folder
7. DEV build only allow access via terminal
