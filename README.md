# ContextPad

## Last updated since
January 25, 2026

## What this is
ContextPad is a localized, offline-first workspace designed for workflow drafting and prompt engineering. It bridges the gap between messy thoughts and structured execution, acting as a "pre-work" tool that lives between thinking and final implementation.

## Why this exists
Standard text editors are too simple for complex drafting, and IDEs are too bloated for creative thinking. ContextPad provides a friction-free environment to prepare text, logic, and context for AI models or project handoffs. 

**What it is NOT:**
- A code compiler or runner.
- A project management platform.
- A cloud-synced collaboration tool.

## Key Features
- **Smart Logic:** Execute Excel-like formulas or JavaScript transformations directly on text.
- **Dynamic Templates:** Injection-ready snippets with automatic variable detection.
- **Safe Drafting:** Syntax-aware code block locking and interactive form fields.
- **AI Readiness:** Real-time token estimation (GPT/Claude/Gemini) and cost projection.
- **Workspace Navigation:** Folder-aware breadcrumbs and headers-based document outline.

## Quick Start
1. Download the latest binary from `/releases`.
2. Open a workspace folder (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+O`).
3. Use the Welcome tab for an interactive walkthrough.

## Requirements
- OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux (Tauri-supported).
- Runtime: No external dependencies for binaries.

## Project Status
Stable / Active.
